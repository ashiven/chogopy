## About

**ChoGoPy** is a compiler for the [ChocoPy language](https://chocopy.org/) written purely in Go as a fun way to learn more about compilers and get better at Go.
It includes multiple analysis passes that perform type checking, variable scope analysis, and more, and compiles down to LLVM IR for flexibility and platform support.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashiven/chogopy.git
```

2. Compile the compiler.

```bash
go build -o cgp
```

## Usage
By default **ChoGoPy** will run every analysis and transformation pass available to it. You are, however, able to specify the exact 
stages that the compiler should go through by using the following command line flags: 

- `-l` to emit only the tokens generated by the lexer.
- `-p` to parse the given source code and print the resulting AST.
- `-t` to parse the given source code and perform static type checking on it.
- `-n` to parse the given source code and perform name scope analysis on it.
- `-c` to generate LLVM IR from the given source code.

An exemplary command would look as follows:

```bash
./cgp -p test.choc
```
